# Predicting-climate-change-effects-on-carbon-sequestration-using-DL
A data-driven analysis of carbon sequestration trends using Python. This project processes CO₂ sequestration data, computes key metrics, identifies long- and short-term trends, and visualizes patterns to understand ecosystem carbon capture dynamics over time, aiding climate impact studies.

## 2. 💡 Motivation  
Climate change mitigation heavily depends on understanding how ecosystems capture and store atmospheric CO₂. Carbon sequestration analysis helps scientists, policymakers, and researchers estimate carbon capture potential and predict future climate trends.  
This project aims to process CO₂ sequestration data, compute important metrics, analyze short- and long-term trends, and visualize results — ultimately providing a foundation for sustainable environmental decision-making.

## 4. ⚙️ Implementation Overview  
1. 🗂️ **Data Preparation:**
   
   - Satellite images are organized within a base directory.
   - A 70 : 30 train–test split is created automatically using the split_data() function.
   - Separate folders train/ and test/ are generated for subsequent model training and evaluation.
     
2. 🎨 **Data Augmentation:**
   
   - To address the limited dataset size, classical augmentation is applied:  
     - Rotation
     - Flipping
     - Zooming
     - Brightness variation
     - Noise injection
   - Augmentation increases sample diversity, improving the model’s generalization capability.
     
3. ✂️ **Image Segmentation:**
   
   - Each image is segmented to isolate regions relevant to carbon content estimation. 
   - The segmentation step prepares inputs for the learning model, emphasizing vegetated and high-carbon zones.
     
4. 🏗️ **Model Architecture:**
    
   The model is designed to capture rich spatial features from satellite images for precise carbon sequestration estimation. It integrates the following components: 
   - 1. ResNet-50 Encoder:
       - Serves as the backbone to extract hierarchical spatial features from input images.
       - Pre-trained weights from ImageNet improve feature extraction on limited datasets.
   - 2. Attention Blocks:
       - Applied at intermediate layers to focus on relevant vegetation and high-carbon regions.
       - Enhances feature representation by emphasizing important spatial areas.
   - 3. ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) Module:
       - Captures multi-scale contextual information using dilated convolutions.
       - Helps the network understand features at different spatial resolutions.
   - 4. Decoder (U-Net–style)
       - Uses transposed convolutions to upsample features and reconstruct spatial maps.
       - Skip connections from encoder layers retain fine-grained spatial details.
   - 5. Output:
       - Produces a binary or density mask representing vegetation/carbon-rich regions.
       - The mask is later used to compute quantitative carbon sequestration metrics.
         
5. ⚡ **Training Procedure:**

   - Data are normalized and batched for efficient GPU processing.
   - The model is compiled using an adaptive optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a Dice loss function.
   - Training metrics such as loss and accuracy are logged for each epoch.
   - Early stopping and model checkpoints ensure optimal performance without overfitting.

6. 📊 **Evaluation and Visualization:**

   - Predictions are compared against the ground-truth carbon data stored in a CSV file.
   - Visualization routines plot original vs. predicted images 🖼️ and display the learning curves 📈.
   - The resulting CSV of predicted carbon values supports downstream climate-trend analysis.

7. 🚀 **Future Integration:**

   - The trained model can be extended with additional temporal datasets to enhance forecasting.
   - Integration with generative models 🤖 or transfer learning 🔄 is suggested for data augmentation and spatial up-sampling.

# Predicting-climate-change-effects-on-carbon-sequestration-using-DL
A data-driven analysis of carbon sequestration trends using Python. This project processes COâ‚‚ sequestration data, computes key metrics, identifies long- and short-term trends, and visualizes patterns to understand ecosystem carbon capture dynamics over time, aiding climate impact studies.

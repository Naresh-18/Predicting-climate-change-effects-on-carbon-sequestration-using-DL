# Predicting-climate-change-effects-on-carbon-sequestration-using-DL
A data-driven analysis of carbon sequestration trends using Python. This project processes CO₂ sequestration data, computes key metrics, identifies long- and short-term trends, and visualizes patterns to understand ecosystem carbon capture dynamics over time, aiding climate impact studies.

## 2. 💡 Motivation  
Climate change mitigation heavily depends on understanding how ecosystems capture and store atmospheric CO₂. Carbon sequestration analysis helps scientists, policymakers, and researchers estimate carbon capture potential and predict future climate trends.  
This project aims to process CO₂ sequestration data, compute important metrics, analyze short- and long-term trends, and visualize results — ultimately providing a foundation for sustainable environmental decision-making.

## 3. 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:**  
  - `pandas` – Data handling and preprocessing  
  - `numpy` – Numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` – Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` *(optional)* – For additional trend modeling  
- **Dataset:** CO₂ sequestration results generated from satellite-based or simulation data (`CO2_seq.csv`)

## 4. ⚙️ Implementation Overview  
1. **Data Loading:** Reads CO₂ sequestration data from a CSV file.  
2. **Trend Analysis:**  
   - Performs linear regression to determine overall trends (increasing/decreasing).  
   - Computes rate of change and key metrics (mean, max, min, std deviation).  
   - Uses rolling windows to analyze short-term fluctuations.  
3. **Metric Computation:**  
   - Moving Average  
   - Running Total  
   - Expanding Mean  
4. **Visualization:**  
   - Plots trends and time-series graphs for better interpretability.  
   - Exports detailed trend analysis results as a CSV and visual plots as PNG.
